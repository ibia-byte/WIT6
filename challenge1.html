      <header><h2>Introduction</h2></header>
      <p>This book presents a practical introduction to the process of making websites using a blend of the latest and greatest
      techniques, as well as a healthy understanding of some older technologies that have been around for a while. The
      techniques described in this book are informed by having solved real-world problems; so, although it has an eye toward
      the future it’s grounded in the act of making websites today.</p>

      <p>HTML is a markup language, which may sound complicated until you realize that you come across markup every day. When
      creating a document in a word processor, you can add styles to the text to explain the document’s structure. For
      example, you can distinguish headings from the main body of the text using a heading style (usually with a larger font)
      CSS works by enabling you to associate rules with the elements that appear in a web page. These rules govern how the
      content of those elements should be rendered.
</p>
      <li>Not only will you learn the code that makes up HTML, but you will also see how to apply this code so you can create
      sophisticated layouts for your pages, positioning text and images where you would like them to appear and getting the colors and fonts you want</li>
    </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Tags and elements ">
        <header><h2>Tags and elements</h2></header>
        <p>A pair of tags and the content these include are known as an element.The opening tag says, “This is the beginning of a heading” and the closing tag says, “This is the end of a heading.”
        Like most tags in HTML, the text inside the angled brackets explains the purpose of the tag</p>
        <p>You often find that terms from a family tree are used to describe the relationships between elements. For example, an
        element that contains another element is known as the parent, whereas the element that’s between the parent element’s
        opening and closing tags is called a child of that element.
      </p>
        <li>You must understand the basic distinction between tags and elements: A tag usually consists of left-angle and
        right-angle brackets and letters and numbers between those brackets, whereas elements are the opening and closing tags
        plus anything between the two tags</li>

        <p>As you work through the examples in this book, you may choose either to type in all the code manually or to use the
        source code files that accompany the book. All of the source code used in this book is available for download at
        www.wrox.com. Specifically for this book, the code download is on the Download Code tab at
        www.wrox.com/remtitle.cgi?isbn=9781118340189.</p>
        <p>Once you download the code, just decompress it with your favorite compression tool. Alternately, you can go to the main
        Wrox code download page at www.wrox.com/dynamic/books/download.aspx to see the code available for this book and all
        other Wrox books.

        <li>If you find an error in this book, such as a spelling mistake or faulty piece of code, I would be very grateful for your
        feedback. By sending in errata you may save another reader hours of frustration, and at the same time you will be
        helping to provide even higher quality information.</li>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Links and Style Sheets">
        <header>Links and Style Sheets</header>
        <p>Adding a style sheet relies on the
        link element. The
        link element also uses the href attribute, which you learned about already, to point to a resource on the web. In this
        case, instead of pointing to a new page or website to visit when a link is clicked, it points to the location of a file
        containing style information for the current page. The rel (for relation) attribute indicates that the linked document
        is a style sheet and should be handled accordingly</p>
        <code><link rel="stylesheet" href="challenge1.css">
</code>
        <p>You need to start using one piece of JavaScript. Now that you know how to add a script to the page, you’re ready to
        learn about the HTML5 Shiv and Modernizr.</p>
        <li>Adding a script to the page is even easier. </li>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="The nav element">
        <header><h2>The nav element</h2></header>
        <p>The nav element represents a navigation section of the page, containing a list of links to other pages or site
          sections within the site or application. Because the Example Café site is going to have more than one page, look at
          one way to mark up a simple menu linking to other pages on the site. In this example you can see a series of <p> tags,
          containing links to the site’s other pages. </p>
            <code>
              <p><a href="recipes.html">Recipes</p>
              <p><a href="menu.html">Menu</a></p>
              <p><a href="opening_times.html">Opening Times</a></p>
            
</code>
        <p>Later you learn about working with lists and learn a more common pattern
        for marking up navigational elements. For now, just focus on the use of the <nav> element</p>
        <li>lists can be ordered, where we use numbers or unordered where forexample bullets are used</li>
